# Blackjack-Sim
A sheet that creates, and then tests basic blackjack strategy using Dynamic Programming and Monte-Carlo. Graphs are provided in the jupyter notebooks for better visualisation of the policies.

## Dynamic Programming
DP uses the probabilities of reaching and probable reward a certain next state to calculate the value of the current state.

## Monte-Carlo
A monte carlo simulation runs a virtual simulation of the event a large number of times, and then calculates the estimated value of each state by averaging the returns.
